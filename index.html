              There are many paths to get to low-carbon electricity. Each path has different advantages and costs. This tool allows you to learn about how electricity generation works, and lets you explore different paths.
            </p>
            <p>
              This tool computes which mixture of electricity generation technologies fulfills the overall demand of the United States for the least cost. As you use the tool, you can change your assumptions about policies, future technologies, and costs. The best mixture will shift depending on your assumptions.
            </p>
            <p>
              We breakdown the cost of electricity generation into the cost to build capacity and the continuing cost to operate a plant. Unlike the commonly-used “levelized cost of electricity”, the tool keeps track of how much electricity is generated at which time, and makes sure that the demand never goes unfilled. The tool reports the cost (per household) it would take to gradually rebuild the grid over 30 years. The tool also shows the amount of CO2 reduction relative to today’s grid.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today’s electricity generation offers a mix of technologies. Some (like natural gas) can quickly turn on-and-off. This is called “dispatchable power”. Others (like nuclear power) are operated to produce a constant amount of power. Still others (like solar) are intermittent and only produce energy when conditions permit.
            </p>

            <h2>High renewables</h2>
            <p>
              One strategy to lower CO2 emissions is to build more renewable electricity sources. Renewable Portfolio Standards  (RPS) are often used to build such sources:  RPS requires a fraction of electricity to come from renewable sources. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Renewable sources are intermittent (or limited in their total capacity). The gap between demand and the variable supply needs to be filled in somehow. Our model includes storage that can be large enough to store wind and solar energy across the seasons. This approach, however, is very expensive when the RPS fraction gets close to 100%.
            </p>

            <hr/>
            <h2>Carbon capture and sequestration</h2>
            <p>
              Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) works by capturing the CO2 from fossil fuels before it can be emitted into the air and sequestering it into the ground. Demonstration CCS systems are working at plant scale. However, it will always be more expensive to capture CO2 than to release it, so CCS will only be widespread if a policy encourages it: either a price on carbon, or changing RPS to be a “Low-Carbon Portfolio Standard” (LCPS) and including CCS into the standard.
            </p>
            <p>
              One benefit of CCS: it is also applicable to any industrial process where heat is generated by fossil fuels. This include processes such as cement production.
            </p>

            <h2>Advanced nuclear</h2>
            <p>
              Existing nuclear power is expensive and mostly not dispatchable. However, the latest technologies can be substantially safer and less expensive than existing nuclear power. Setting the slider to assume lower cost implies building new nuclear plants with this latest technology, and streamlining the regulation process to reduce the time and cost to construct the plants.

              This tool allows you to make different assumptions about policies, technologies, and energy costs and see what is the least expensive way to rebuild the grid and fulfill demand. In this section, you can change the underlying costs of the energy sources, such as natural gas.
            </p>
            <p>
              You are welcome to play with the tool to learn about the economics of electricity. From our explorations of the tool, we’ve come to a few conclusions:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Trying to attain very low CO2 emissions through high RPS is going to be very expensive, because storing electricity across the year requires a prohibitive amount of storage.
              </li>
              <li>
                We can get to low CO2 emissions without spending a lot more on electricity than today, but only with new technologies that can deliver low-carbon electricity 24 hours a day (“baseload”). These technologies include:
                <ul>
                  <li>Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS)</li>
                  <li>Advanced nuclear power</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                If natural gas prices stay low, then CCS will be cheaper than advanced nuclear power. If natural gas prices rise (or are high already, in such places as Europe or Japan), then advanced nuclear power will be the least expensive way to provide zero-carbon baseload.
              </li>
